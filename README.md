# Bayesian Machine learning project : study of the Stochastic Weighted average method for Bayesian Bayesian_ML_SWAG

This is the repository of our study of the article : https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02476

We use as a reference to many function we used the github repository of https://github.com/wjmaddox/swa_gaussian which implements the SWAG algorithm for many image dataset and image classification models.
