# Bayesian Machine learning project : study of the Stochastic Weighted average method for Bayesian Bayesian_ML_SWAG

This is the repository of our study of the article : https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02476

We use as a reference to many function we used the github repository of https://github.com/wjmaddox/swa_gaussian which implements the SWAG algorithm for many image dataset and image classification models.

We provide three jupyter notebook :

1.   NLP_comparasion_optimizer_AG_NEWS.ipynb contains a classification model on the AG NEWS Dataset of 4 optimizers : SGD + Step LR Scheduler, Adagrad, SGD + Cosine Scheduler.

2.   NLP_comparasion_optimizer_AG_NEWS.ipynb contains a classification model on the AG NEWS Dataset of 4 optimizers : SGD + Step LR Scheduler, Adagrad, SGD + Cosine Scheduler.

3.   plot_the_results.ipynb which read the csv files and plot the results.
